								<p>I completed my bachelors in physics at UC Santa Cruz in 2016, and I recieved my PhD in astronomy from the
								University of Alabama in 2025. In between I also worked at a start-up company that teaches computer programming to 
								k-12 students using a project-based curriculum. At the University of Alabama I taught introductory physics and
								astronomy classes. I have also had adjunct positions at West Virginia University, Parkersburg and Union College, New
								Jersey. 
								</p>
								
								<p>I use simulations, mock observations, and advanced computational methods such as machine learning to find hidden
								patterns in large datasets. Most of my work uses <a href="https://www.tng-project.org/" target="_blank">IlustrisTNG
								data</a>, but I also use Hubble data to study the photometry and abundances of red giant stars. 
								</p>

								<p>Aside from astronomy I am interested in the philosophy of science and epistemology, or, "how we know what we
								know". As someone who uses machine learning for research, I believe it is important to understand the psychology
								behind misinformation, and how it spreads.
								</p>
								
								<p>I have over a decade of experience teaching STEM subjects in a variety of instructional modes and teaching
								environments. My teaching style is driven by cutting-edge research into effective pedagogy. Recently, I have been
								interested in active learning and how to introduce it into large lectures. My goal when teaching is always to
								understand the student first.  <!--See <a href="#Teaching">Teaching</a> for more information.-->
								</p>
								
								<p>I am also interested in science outreach. I helped start the Physics and Astronomy Graduate Student Association
								(PAGSA) at UA, and created and ran the <a href="http://www.pagsaua.com/" target="_blank">website</a> for several
								years. I have given many public talks, and I volunteer at the 
								<a href="https://www.repaircafe.org/en/cafe/tuscaloosa-public-library-repair-cafe-al/" target="_blank">Tuscaloosa
								Public Library Repair Cafe</a>, where I teach children and adults about the inner workings of common household
								electronics.

								<p>I use cosmological magnetohydrodynamic simulations to study the gas dynamics of galaxies and how that effects their evolution. "Cosmological" means that a large chunk of the universe is simulated. "Magnetohydrodynamic" means the simulations include electromagnetic forces ("magneto") as well as fluid/thermodynamic forces such as pressure. These simulations contain a huge amount of information, and new techniques are needed to properly process it. Hydrodynamic simulations and machine learning may sound intimidating, but my research is relatively intuitive, and does not require previous experience. I have had a lot of undergraduate assistance in my work, and I'm always happy to have more!</p>
								
								<p>Mass is an assumed driver of differences between galaxies. In <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/addf46" target="_blank">my first paper</a>, we stacked IllustrisTNG halos by mass and feedback type to look for correlations in the motion of the gas. By seperating our sample into groups by both star-formation rate and black hole activity, we can isolate the effects of each feedback type. We found that feedback type had a stronger impact on gas dynamics than mass. The image above shows plots of the average mass flow for low feedback halos (top) and star-forming halos (bottom). Inflows (outflows) are negative (positive). Low feedback galaxies have the largest inflow (blue and green lines) near \(0.2R_v\), which serves as a dividing line between the inner and outer CGM. Star-forming halos, however, have the highest inflow at maximum radius, because the larger outflows (red line) from central star-formation reduces the inflow at low radius.</p>
								
								<p>This plot also includes the effects of the "fuzz"-- a collection of particles not easily accessed in the simulation, that nonetheless have significant effects on both gas dynamics and observables such as column density. It is important to compare simulations with observations, but these comparisons will not be even if all mass along a line of sight is measured in observations, and only "member particle density" is measured in simulations. Fuzz particles are more enriched than surrounding halo gas, and tend to move outward, implying they may be connected to feedback events. I had several undergraduates help me with tracking the fuzz between snapshots and characterize their motion.</p>
								
								<p>I also designed the software infrastucture for the Circumgalactic Dictionary. The circumgalactic medium (CGD) is a diffuse but expansive collection of gas surrounding galaxies. Most gas and metal is actually in the CGM, quite for from the bright centers of galaxies. But because the gas does not give off much light, it is hard to study directly. The Circumgalactic Dictionary will use the open-source python packages yt and Trident to create millions of mock spectra of IllustrisTNG. This high density sample of sightlines will be used to train a machine learning algorithm to predict underlying gas properties based on observables such as column density and halo properties such as star formation rate, halo mass, etc. We had one undergraduate on this project who recently got a masters degree, and another is currently doing a first analysis of the spectral data.</p>
								
								<p>Recently I joined a group that is creating a machine learning model that will use photometry to predict the chemical abundances of red giants within globyular clusters. Globular clusters are very old, dense clumps of stars that retain information about the gas they formed from, telling us about the gas that was in the Milky Way billions of years ago. The initial data gathering and processing, and succssful HST proposal, were all done by a team of undergraduates (and the PI, <a href="https://physics.ua.edu/people/jeremy-bailin/">Jeremy Bailin</a>). I am supervising an undergraduate in making the final model, and helping the original undergraduate team move their code and documentation to GitHub.</p>
								
								<h3>Current Undergraduate Research Opportunities</h3>
								<p>Current open undergraduate projects include, but are not limited to: </p>
								<ul>
									<li>characterizing the mass and metal flow of halos that are going to stop star-formation in the near future, to predict quenching</li>
									<li>finding the origins of the fuzz, and what causes the systematic differences between fuzz particles and nearby halo particles</li>
									<li>contribute to initial analysis of Circumgalactic Dictionary results, focusing on connections between spectral and galactic properties</li>
									<li>use our globular cluster machine learning model to create and analyze an expanded database of abundances for red giants in Milky Way globular clusters</li>

								<p>This area under construction!</p>
								<!--<p>I have been teaching STEM subjects professionally for over ten years. I keep up with pedagogical theory and follow the data, which says that standing in front of a room and talking at the class is not effective. Instructors need to be creative and responsive to students.</p>
								
								<p>Before graduate school I worked at UCode in Los Angeles, 
California, where I taught k-12 students about computer programming. We used a project-based curriculum, where students created video games designed to impart specific skills. </p>
								
								<p>At the University of Alabama (UA), I often taught the Introduction to Astronomy lecture or lab, GE courses for non-science majors. Astronomy is one of the world's oldest sciences, and developments in astronomy have coincided with developments in the nature of human 
thought. I set aside time in my lectures to highlight important minority contributions to the field and provide historical context around the many paradigm-shifting revelations astronomy has brough us. It is also in the lab course that I gained experience with studio-style teaching. I have also taught a variety of introductory or intermediate level 
physics courses, both at the University of Alabama and online at West Virginia University, Parkersburg (WVUP), and soon at Union College, of Union County, New Jersey (UCNJ).</p>
								
								<p>I think an important part of teaching is learning from the student. Learning why they think about the world the way they do and helping them evaluate their reasoning. The best outcome is that students learn how to teach themselves physics.</p>
								
								<p>That all sounds great! But how do you do it? By crafting engaging and high-effort lectures and interspersing them with activities that require students to think actively and carefully about the material. Group work is also ideal. In these activities, it is important to leave time for students to be wrong. A group of students who discuss a question or task amongst themselves and come to a mutual understanding will learn more than a group of students who have the explanation given by an instructor. Instead, the instructor should guide these discussions to ensure the correct conclusions are reached.</p>
								
								<p>I know this fits the description of how I personally learned physics. But I and every other physics and astronomy professor are outliers; most students will not pursue science as their life passion. It is important to appeal to your broader audience when you can by touching on the interdisciplinary nature and historical importance of the hard sciences; bring up the huge philosophical implications of Copernicus' and Galileo's work, bring up the historical context around Marie Curie, Emmy Noether, and Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. Talk about how transistors revolutionized computing. Tell them about ancient Chinese astronomers recording SN 1054. Find contributions from minority scientists, find stories to tell. The students are expected to pay attention to the instructor's interests for 1-3 hours at a time; 
breaking up the material and introducing small stories like this helps students refocus their attention.</p>

								<p>I have also mentored several undergraduate researchers. The focus here is definitely more on guidance than instruction. However, you also don't want to withhold answers as you might in a classroom. Research holds enough unsolved problems that this is not necessary to challenge the student. Instead, the mentor should help the student develop skills by assigning them appropriate tasks, and meeting to discuss progress.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/TNG50_flow.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The main background image on this site is an edge-on TNG50 galaxy, where gas density is in purple-to-orange and the arrows represent the direction and magnitude of mass flow. These images are prepared by the TNG team and more can be found <a href="https://www.tng-project.org/explore/gallery/" target="_blank">here</a>. This particular galaxy has a mass of \(10^{11.7}M_{\odot}\), which is similar to the Milky Way, and places it in the star-forming regime. The mass is strongly outflowing along the polar regions, and there is significant inflow along the disk (mostly on the left side). <a \href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/addf46" target="_blank">My first paper</a> stacked TNG100 halos of similar mass and feedback type to examine the average distribution of bulk material flows in the circumgalactic medium. We found that higher mass star-forming galaxies experience the most metal enrichment because their larger gravitational wells result in better retention of outflowing material. Meanwhile, more massive galaxies (\(M>10^{12.0}M_{\odot}\)) fall into the active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback regime. This feedback quenches the galaxy and expells large amounts of material from the central region, enriching the intergalactic medium.</p>
